# Housing-Data-analysis-
This a is project based on ML where with the help of Linear regression analysis is done to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable gives give us the final predicted output
In this project first, we have to understand the data and look for the best model which can be used to give the prediction for that we have to go step by step
At the very first step, we have to read the dataset and do missing data treatmbecauseause you may build a biased machine learning model which will lead to incorrect results if the missing values are not handled properly. 
After that, we have to go and remove all the unwanted things from the data and ultimately drop the data which is not relevant.
Once these steps of missing data treatment are done you have to start with preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis to make the model ready
After the EDA you have to go for regularization to check the overfitting and underfitting of the model to get the best.
If the model gives best results in terms of test error and tarin error we can go for the pridiction of the model and give the final prediction.
At the step we will extarct the file on required type for further analysis.
